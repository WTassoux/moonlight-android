 * A lock-free queue for single consumer, single producer. Not thread-safe when using multiple

 * element.
 *
 * @tparam T - The item type
 * @tparam CAPACITY - Maximum number of items which can be held in the queue. Must be a power of 2.
 * Must be less than the maximum value permissible in INDEX_TYPE
 * @tparam INDEX_TYPE - The internal index type, defaults to uint32_t. Changing this will affect
 * the maximum capacity. Included for ease of unit testing because testing queue lengths of
 * UINT32_MAX can be time consuming and is not always possible.

     * and empty states. It also allows us to have a size() method which is easily calculated.
     *

     * writer thread. Have more than one of either will result in Bad Thingsâ„¢.
